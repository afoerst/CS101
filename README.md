This is all the information for students to design their e-folio.

# GitHub.com

1. add 	TERMINAL: git add * (will copy everything. If you don't want it, specify the filename plus extension)
	This is to tell GitHub that I have created a new file

2. commit	TERMINAL: git commit -am adding "README file with all instructions to the repository" (the -a adds changes 	to the history of the file, the m makes sure that you add a description of the file)
	I commit to this version of the file

To know if you have added and committed, use the terminal command in your folder: git status

3. push	TERMINAL: git push (this will put it unto the cloud)

BEST PRACTICES: change only locally and then push - otherwise you will get constant merge conflicts!!!

By now, you should all have a GitHub account. 


# HOW TO CREATE AN E-FOLIO

LEARN HTML: go to w3schools.com (click top left HTML for a free tutorial)

Go to https://github.com/St-Bonaventure-University/portfolio-template for your starter template

Copy website with green "code" button

TERMINAL: go to folder where all your repositories (repos) are. 
TERMINAL: git clone Ctrl-v

Go to a window with your files. Copy all files and folders from your newly created repo into your original repo. Open up index.html and now you see the current version. Happy editing!


If you get tired of your template, go to 

https://lotosikra.github.io/template-categories/all/

Choose a template

You will be on your own though...
