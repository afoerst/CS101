This is all the information for students to design their e-folio.

GitHub.com

add 	TERMINAL: git add * (will copy everything. If you don't want it, specify the filename plus extension)
	This is to tell GitHub that I have created a new file

commit	TERMINAL: git commit -am adding "README file with all instructions to the repository" (the -a adds changes 	to the history of the file, the m makes sure that you add a description of the file)
	I commit to this version of the file

To know if you have added and committed, use the terminal command in your folder: git status

push	TERMINAL: git push (this will put it unto the cloud)
